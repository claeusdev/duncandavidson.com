One thing that’s a pain in the ass about living in Berlin is the airports. Both of the currently operating airports, Tegal and Schönefeld, are Cold War relics that are ill-maintained jokes by modern standards. There has been a replacement airport in the works for years, but it’s been delayed so many times that there are now entire international airports elsewhere in the world that have been conceived, built, and opened in the time that they’ve tried to fix the new Berlin airport’s mess.

They could have scraped the new airport terminal to the ground and rebuilt it in the time they’ve been faffing around trying to fix what’s been built.
