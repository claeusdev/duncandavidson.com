My software development career began in 1995 at a startup in Dallas called The Synapse Group. It was one of the early web interaction agencies. Ben McLemore and Mike Marolda took a chance and hired me out of architecture school to work on some of the very first e-commerce websites, including the first website for [Hilton Hotels](https://hilton.com). The Synapse Group name has almost entirely disappeared through several mergers and only shows up in the [occasional news article archive](https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/stories/1997/09/29/smallb1.html), but the kickstart it gave my career was essential.

Since then, I’ve worked or consulted at several other startups. Many of them have been open source or community driven. Most have either been acquired or have gone out of business. That’s the nature of startups. They bring innovation to the world and then the world integrates that innovation. Even the failures teach us something.

The last startup I was part of was [Wunderlist](https://wunderlist.com), which was bought by Microsoft in 2015. By many measures, it was a successful exit. Staying at Microsoft after the acquisition, however, taught me that there’s more to the story after everyone throws a party and goes home.

My job now is to support senior technologists and Chief Technical Officers (CTOs) at startups, providing advice and helping them prioritize, focus, and think deeply about their work. I then take observations and lessons from that work back into my group at Microsoft to help create a better platform to launch startups.

Of course, I’m learning from startups during this chapter of my career as well. After all, who knows when I’ll get back into the fray and pursue an idea worth implementing.
