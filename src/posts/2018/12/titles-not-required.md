As I build up this iteration of my blog, I'm setting things up so without the hard requirement that every post has a title. That's a change from almost every blog system that I've used or wrote over the years, but I think one of the things that make posting on Twitter or Facebook appealing is the minimal ceremony involved: just start typing.

As well, I've set up the [essays](/essays) section of this site for more extended, more formal writing so biasing the blog towards something a lot looser and informal feels right.
