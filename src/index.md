# Creator of Apache Tomcat and Apache Ant

[Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org) started out as a reference implementation of the [Java Servlet API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_servlet) that I first wrote while working on the specification at Sun Microsystems. To aid the adoption of the Servlet API, I lead an effort in Sun to open source Tomcat and donate it to the Apache Software Foundation. Almost twenty years later, Tomcat is on version 9 and is powering countless websites around the world.

While working on Tomcat, I wanted a build tool that worked on all the platforms that Java ran on. After trying to make many other tools work, I ended up writing my own. And, because it was needed to build Tomcat, it was open sourced and donated to Apache at the same time. Without any fanfare or promotion, a vibrant open source community formed around Ant and continued its maintenance.
